## Introduction
Hello. I am Joyee chakraborty. Recently I have completed my computer science and engineering degree from leading university. As a child I was so inquisitive about every new thing. That nature of mine inspire me today to learn new things. For me adapting to a new technology is easier than settling in a new environment. According to Eleanor Roosevelt, Great minds discuss ideas; average minds discuss events; small minds discuss people. And I believe in this digital era, ideas on technology can create something bigger.
